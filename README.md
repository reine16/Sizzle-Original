# Sizzle-Original
WARNING: This is an inaccessible version of mock restaurant website!  This page has known accessibility issues and is used for demonstration purposes only! 

This webpage was my final project in a course titled Developing Websites and Front-Ends with Bootstrap, in the IBM Front-End Development with Figma, Bootstrap & Git Professional Certificate (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-frontend-developer).  The starter code from the instructor includes the CSS and JS files.  The exercise asks the learner to create the index.html file, copy/paste some basic code references, and add Bootstrap classes.

As I was building my page and copying the starter code, I immediately noticed that the page is not conformant.  I've cloned the repo and am remediating the page.  Please compare this version to the remediated version at https://github.com/reine16/Sizzle-Remediated.
